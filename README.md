# Zomato-Restaurant-Data-Analysis-and-Visulization

**Overview:**

This project explores and analyzes the Zomato restaurant dataset to gain insights into restaurant ratings, cuisines, costs, and geographic distribution. The analysis is performed using Python, and the results are visualized through an interactive dashboard.

**Dataset:**

The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/code/vahidehdashti/complete-zomato-dataset-eda/input?select=zomato.csv.

**Files in Repository:**

**zomato.csv**: Raw dataset containing restaurant details. <br>
**zomato.json:** JSON format of the dataset for easy parsing. <br>
**zomato_eda.ipynb:** Jupyter Notebook containing exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualizations. <br>
**zomato_sweetviz_report.html:** Auto-generated EDA report using Sweetviz for quick insights. <br>
**dashboard.html:** Interactive dashboard displaying visualizations of restaurant trends. <br>
